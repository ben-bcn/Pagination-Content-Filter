# Pagination-Content-Filter
Treehouse tech degree project to create a Pagination &amp; Content Filter

This example allows for the dynamic creation of 'pages' in multiples of 10 people. These lists can then be paged through with links at the bottom of the page.

A seach field is added to the DOM via JS and allows for the list to be filtered by the string entered into the search input field. A reset button appears at this point to enable the clearing of the list.

If no users match the search criteria a message is displayed to them.
